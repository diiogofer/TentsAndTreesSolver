# TentsAndTreesSolver
This project is an automatic solver for the "Tents and Trees" game developed in Prolog. By using pure logic, the program solves the game puzzles, providing an efficient and elegant approach to finding solutions. This hack showcases the power of logic programming and Prolog in solving complex problems automatically.
